# Abstract

This thesis supports the <a href="https://transmixr.eu/"> TransmiXR project  </a>, developing an XR experience at Satore Studio where participants interact with an AI avatar, "Isaac," in a mixed-reality setting. A key contribution is this application for managing multiple XR devices, allowing real-time control, synchronization, and personalized content delivery for immersive, narrative-driven experiences.
